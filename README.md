## Background

The pi-tools repository serves as a centralized collection of scripts, configurations, and utilities for Raspberry Pi systems. These tools aim to simplify common tasks, automate configuration, and extend the functionality of Raspberry Pi devices across various use cases.

Each tool is contained in its own subdirectory with dedicated documentation and implementation details.

## Tools

**Key features:**
- Automated setup via bootstrap script
- SSH key configuration for GitHub integration
- Ansible playbook for complete server configuration
- NFS and Docker service setup
